This file goes with part 8 of the first lab.  The idea is to give you
some practice thinking about the names of functions.  The problem is a
simple one, so we're going the software equivalent of shooting a fly
with an elephant gun, but because the problem is so simple, it makes
it easy to have a short practice session.

Here is the problem:

  - Suggest three different functions that might be useful in
    implementing `brightness`.

  - For each function, suggest three possible names.

  - For each function, say which name you think is most appropriate
    and *why*.



Function #1:

  Job: Calculate the brightness of image

  Candidate names: brightnessCal, calculator, brightness

  Best name: brightnessCal

  Why the given name is the best:
 It covers the function job and it is not too long to write.





Function #2:

  Job: Extract the data from the image for calculation

  Candidate names: readImage, convertImage, getImage

  Best name:readImage

  Why the given name is the best: 
It is easy to remember and cover the function's Job





Function #3:

  Job: check the number of the files and open the correct file.

  Candidate names: openFile, checkFile, check_openFile

  Best name:check_openFile

  Why the given name is the best: 
It includes all the neccesory operations for checking the input 
file name, and opening the file.
