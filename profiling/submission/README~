Most Time-consuming Routine
The most time-consuming routine is map_segment, which makes heavy use of both 
malloc and free. Looking at the assembly code for this area, we could find no
further way to improve the routine

If the test um code include lot of map and unmap segment, we can change the 
map and unmap segment instrctions into inline, this will improve
