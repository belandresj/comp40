UNBLACKEDGES

Please put answers to questions here.

  * What fraction of time is spent in I/O as compared with removing
    black edges?

  remove_black_edges takes  39.90%
  input: pbmread takes      34.28%
  output: pbmwrite takes    25.79%

  * How long does
   
       time ./unblackedges 
  
    take?
    0.49      user 
    0.00      system 
    0:00.53   elapsed 
    94%        CPU
  
  * After making changes requested in the lab handout (steps 1-4), what
    happened to the total time?

    0.49      user 
    0.00      system 
    0:00.52   elapsed 
    93%        CPU
  
  * What happened to the fraction of time spent in Bit_put?

  unblackedges-bfs: 10.23%
  unblackedges:     10.18%
  
  * Since the implementation of Bit_put has not been improved, what has
    changed?
	Since we changed something the fraction of time spent for that
	part will be changed. As a result, other parts' time spent fraction
	of the program will be changed. This is the reason why we not
	change Bit_put, but the Bit_put time fraction changed.
