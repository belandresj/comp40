-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part A: brightness
        In brightness.c, we check the number of arguments at first, the number
should be less than or equal to 1, else print an error and exit. In main
function, we read the image and convert it to the data of all the pixels'
brightness using Pnmrdr, then sum all these to get the total brightness 
value.
        In the calBrightness function, we use the sum, denominator and total 
number of pixels to calculate the average brightness, and print it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part B: readaline
        In readaline.c, we use do-while loop to read characters one by one, until
read the newline character '\n'. If we read the EOF, that means the file end,
then we just free the ptr and return 0.
        We use char **datap to transmit the string value back to the main 
function, by reasign *datap = ptr. And return the length of the string.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part C: similines
    In similines.c, we only contain main function to be used by client. 
We use interface.c to store all the interface function.

    We use Table to store all information of files as a key-value pairs. 
The key of table is Atom, we use Atom because two same Atom has the same
pointer, which means it is easy to find similines. The value of Table is
Sequence. We use Sequence because it is easy to add new information at the 
end of Sequence. In the Sequence, we use struct to store the location
information, including filename and line number.

    First, we convert the raw string to the modified string in which 
there is only one space between two words. Then the modified string was
stored in Atom use Atom_new. Also, we use Atom_length to get the length 
of Atom.

    We use Seq_seq to create a new Sequence, and put the location 
information into the Sequence. If there is already has the sequence value, 
we add the new location information at the end of sequence using Seq_addhi. 
In print and free functions, we use Seq_length and Seq_get to get the 
location pointer to free (use Seq_free) or to print.

    In Table, we use Table_new to create Table, use Table_put to input 
the key-value pair into Table, use Table_get to get the value with key, and 
use Table_map to apply vfree and printGroupMatch functions to free the 
pointer (Sequence and Location pointer) and print the group matching lines 
information.
